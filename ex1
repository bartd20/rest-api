1a. Use curl with the "--insecure" option to view the NetBox top-level /api endpoint. An example of this would be:

curl -L -s https://netbox.lasthop.io/api/ --insecure

You can also pipe this into the "jq" utility for prettier output:

curl -L -s https://netbox.lasthop.io/api/ --insecure | jq

Note, you will possibly need to add the "-L" argument to all of the "curl" requests (this instructs "curl" to follow any redirects).


1b. Use curl to access "https://netbox.lasthop.io/api/dcim/devices/". This API endpoint requires authentication; use the "-H" flag to provide this authentication information. Note, the lab has a NETBOX_TOKEN environment variable. Consequently, you should be able to do the following:

curl -H "Authorization: Token $NETBOX_TOKEN" https://netbox.lasthop.io/api/dcim/devices/ --insecure | jq


1c. Use curl to retrieve only the device information for a single device (ID=2 for example). Once again this will require authorization. The API URL for this would be (assuming ID 2):

https://netbox.lasthop.io/api/dcim/devices/2/
